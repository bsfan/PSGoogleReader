PSGoogleReader is a class that connects to Google Reader.  I don't have a pretty
demo UI set up, so you won't see much in the simulator when you run this app.  Check
NSLog output to see very simplified demo results.

Be sure to set your client (app) name in PSGoogleReader.m
Set your Google Reader username/password in PSGoogleReaderAppDelegate.m

Code license is pretty generous.  See comments at the top of PSGoogleReader.m for details.
